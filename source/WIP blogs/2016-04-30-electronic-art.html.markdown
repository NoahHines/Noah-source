Spring semester 2016, I was enrolled in two studio art classes to satisfy the requirements for my graphic design minor.

The first class is Electronic Art and Intermedia I, which focuses on understanding the history of intermedia, communicating with digital tools, and “develop[ing] an epistemic methodology by incorporating research, experimentation, experience and play into the art process.” ([Adam Brown](http://adamwbrown.net/teaching-3/electronic-art))

The second class is Digital Fabrication I: a project-based class focusing on 3D modeling and fabrication techniques. For this class, we had access to a CNC mill, CO2 laser cutter, and a 3D printer.

Both of these classes were taught by Adam W. Brown, an Associate Professor at Michigan State University who created the Electronic Art & Intermedia study. Throughout the semester, Adam encouraged us to focus on topics we found interesting. My classmates created fantastic pieces based on topics ranging from religion, feminism, pop culture, and mythology. I chose to focus on science and technology: specifically, space travel.
